"As a [Developer],one of my goals is to design a website that is not only functional, but also responsive, safe, and well-optimized for performance. In this way, the website will be able to provide a smooth and enjoyable experience for its users, as well as realize the goals of the project and adhere to the norms and guidelines established by the industry.

By following this template, you can create user stories that are structured and easy to understand. To make the user story even more effective, you can add acceptance criteria that specify the requirements that must be met to consider the user story complete. Here's an example of a user story with acceptance criteria:

"As a customer, I want to view my order history so that I can track my past purchases."

Acceptance Criteria:
1. The website's branding has to be very obvious and consistent throughout all of its pages and components.
2. The website in question must be operational and provide all of the features and functionality that are specified in the project requirements.
3. The website in question has to have a responsive design and be able to function properly on all main devices and screen sizes, such as desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
4. The website has to have strong security measures in place to prevent unwanted access, misuse, and attempts to hack it.
